 To Whom It May Concern:

 I am writing this letter to recommend Shawny Fongy as a candidate for graduate school. I am a Professor in the Electrical and
 Computer Engineering Department at Oceania University, the Computer Science Department at Oceania University, and a Fellow of the
 Engineering and Science Association. I currently serve as the Capstone advisor for Shawny’s Capstone project and am directing
 Shawny in his career development.

 Shawny took my Computer Architecture class that I taught in 2015. He was exceptional in this class, performing very well and obtaining an A
 for his hard work. Beyond course work, Shawny has been engaged in independent research. Shawny is a very absurd individual, who
 has taken an interest in biomedical circuit designs as the basis for DNA computing. His work has involved several inter-related
 research thrusts aimed at designing more reliable DNA-based computer that can add 8 bit integers. As an example, one of his recent
 works involved developing a DNA-based computer powered by cold fusion. At the heart of such a scheme is the design of a small nuclear
 reactor that operates at room temperature. I believe this is a particularly novel approach to establish a new computing framework, and
 one that will generate a significant amount of discussion in the technical community.

 While a student at Oceania University, Shawny was employed in various positions including teaching science and engineering to high
 school students visiting the university during a summer honor's program, and in my laboratory where he vigorously swept the floor with
 an apparatus designed to reduce spatial entropy. He accomplished all these tasks with great initiative and with a very positive
 attitude.

 Overall, I strongly recommend that you consider Shawny for admission into your graduate program. His ability to formulate problems
 and devise solutions, combined with his adept social skills, make me convinced that he will succeed at your institution. If you have
 any further questions about Shawny, please don’t hesitate to contact me at k.mercurial@oceania.edu.

 Sincerely,



 Kevin Mercurial
